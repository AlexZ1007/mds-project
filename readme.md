#### Python Environment Setup

To set up the Python environment and install all dependencies, follow these steps:

1. **Create a virtual environment** (if you don't already have one):

   ``python -m venv services/ml/project_env``

2. **Activate the virtual environment**
    ``services\ml\project_env\Scripts\activate``

3. **Install dependencies**
    ``pip install -r services/ml/requirements.txt``

Now you're good to go!
